# BatchRip
Shell Scripts from Yamada's auto-ripping/tagging software build

Hey folks, 
In November of 2019, the TVdb changed their API system and doing so broke a lot of software/programming that relied on the previous API. Robert Yamada's BatchRip actions was one of the programs that lost functionality. As a long time fan of open-source and of Yamada's efforts, I wanted to step up to help. I'm not a GitHub expert but I figured I'd get things started for the community. 

So here it is, at least for the moment: corrections issued to three of Yamada's buried shell scripts:

Script #1: The Main script located in your local file structure at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Batch\ Rip.action/Contents/Resources/main.command
and located in this build here: https://github.com/tallfunnyjew/BatchRip/blob/master/Library/Automator/Batch%20Rip.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

Script #2: The Rename TV Items script located at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Rename\ TV\ Items.action/Contents/Resources/main.command

Script #3: The Tag TV Items script located at:
/Applications/Batch\ Rip\ Actions\ for\ Automator.app/Contents/Library/Automator/Add\ TV\ Tags.action/Contents/Resources/main.command
